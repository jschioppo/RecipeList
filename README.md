##Acknowledgments

I want to give a big shoutout to Stack Overflow, without you my nights of programming would be A LOT longer.

Another shoutout to /r/learnprogramming, for being a great source of motivation in starting my own project.

The Big Ranch Guide's Android Programming book has been a great source of awesome information so far, it gave me a great start and made me feel confident to start this project on my own after about three chapters.
